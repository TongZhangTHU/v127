abstract: 'One fundamental problem in causal inference is the treatment effect estimation
  in obser- vational studies, and its key challenge is to handle the confounding bias
  induced by the associations between covariates and treatment variable. In this paper,
  we study the prob- lem of effect estimation on continuous treatment from observational
  data, going beyond previous work on binary treatments. Previous work for binary
  treatment focuses on de- confounding by balancing the distribution of covariates
  between the treated and control groups with either propensity score or confounder
  balancing techniques. In the continuous setting, those methods would fail as we
  can hardly evaluate the distribution of covariates under each treatment status.
  To tackle the case of continuous treatments, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial
  De-confounding (GAD) algorithm to eliminate the associa- tions between covariates
  and treatment variable with two main steps: (1) generating an “calibration” distribution
  without associations between covariates and treatment by ran- dom perturbation;
  (2) learning sample weight that transfer the distribution of observed data to the
  “calibration” distribution for de-confounding with a Generative Adversarial Network.
  Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
  our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for effect estimation of
  con- tinuous treatment with observational data.'
