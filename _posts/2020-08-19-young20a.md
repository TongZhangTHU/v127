abstract: Most causal discovery algorithms find causal structure among a set of observed
  variables. Learning the causal structure among latent variables remains an important
  open problem, particularly when using high-dimensional data. In this paper, we address
  a problem for which it is known that inputs cause outputs, and these causal relationships
  are encoded by a causal network among a set of an unknown number of latent variables.
  We developed a deep learning model, which we call a redundant input neural network
  (RINN), with a modified architecture and a regularized objective function to find
  causal relationships between input, hidden, and output variables. More specifically,
  our model allows input variables to directly interact with all latent variables
  in a neural network to influence what information the latent variables should encode
  in order to generate the output variables accurately. In this setting, the direct
  connections between input and latent variables makes the latent variables partially
  interpretable; furthermore, the connectivity among the latent variables in the neural
  network serves to model their potential causal relationships to each other and to
  the output variables. A series of simulation experiments provide support that the
  RINN method can successfully recover latent causal structure between input and output
  variables.
