abstract: We address the problem of counterfactual regression using causal inference
  (CI) in obser- vational studies consisting of high dimensional covariates and high
  cardinality treatments. Confounding bias, which leads to inaccurate treatment effect
  estimation, is attributed to covariates that affect both treatments and outcome.
  The presence of high-dimensional co- variates exacerbates the impact of bias as
  it is harder to isolate and measure the impact of these confounders. In the presence
  of high-cardinality treatment variables, CI is rendered ill-posed due to the increase
  in the number of counterfactual outcomes to be predicted. We propose Hi-CI, a deep
  neural network (DNN) based framework for estimating causal effects in the presence
  of large number of covariates, and high-cardinal and continuous treatment variables.
  The proposed architecture comprises of a decorrelation network and an outcome prediction
  network. In the decorrelation network, we learn a data representa- tion in lower
  dimensions as compared to the original covariates, and addresses confounding bias
  alongside. Subsequently, in the outcome prediction network, we learn an embedding
  of high-cardinality and continuous treatments, jointly with the data representation.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of causal effect prediction of the proposed Hi-CI network
  using synthetic and real-world NEWS datasets.
