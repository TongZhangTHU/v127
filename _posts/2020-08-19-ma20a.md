abstract: Shapley value is a concept from game theory. Recently, it has been used
  for explaining complex models produced by machine learning techniques. Although
  the mathematical definition of Shapley value is straight-forward, the implication
  of using it as a model inter- pretation tool is yet to be described. In the current
  paper, we analyzed Shapley value in the Bayesian network framework. We established
  the relationship between Shapley value and conditional independence, a key concept
  in both predictive and causal modeling. Our results indicate that, eliminating a
  variable with high Shapley value from a model do not necessarily impair predictive
  performance, whereas eliminating a variable with low Shapley value from a model
  could impair performance. Therefore, using Shapley value for feature selection do
  not result in the most parsimonious and predictively optimal model in the general
  case. More importantly, Shapley value of a variable do not reflect their causal
  relationship with the target of interest.
